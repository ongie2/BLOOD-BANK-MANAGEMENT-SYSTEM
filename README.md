# BLOOD-BANK-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
Blood Donors Management System (BDMS) is a browser based system that is designed to store, process, retrieve and analyse information concerned with the administrative and inventory management within a blood bank. This project aims at maintaining all the information pertaining to blood donors, different blood groups available in each blood bank and help them manage in a better way.  Donating blood is a crucial yet easy way to save lives of those who are in need of blood, hence the real reason for creating a database that will help people who wish to donate blood be regular donors which according to medical research donors can donate blood every eight weeks.
